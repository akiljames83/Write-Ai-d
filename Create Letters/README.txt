This code was used to create the drawings of the letters used in the training of the tensorflow machine learning algorithm.
There is both a python file and an executable file that can be used to run the code.
Important to note, to recreate the executable file, the 'codeForExecutable.txt' file can be used however it is a 
command line command and the cmd prompt must be opened in this folder for it to file the requisite files.

Enjoy,
